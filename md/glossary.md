# Glossary

## Block & Parameter Names

## Block Comments

Block comments are texts attached to a block using the _Add comment_ context menu entry.
The text is displayed in a box that can be moved and resized.
Blocks that have comments attached have a question mark (?) button to show or hide the text.
The comment text is printed, as a comment, when the block is evaluated.

## Categories

The blocks in the toolbox are organised into categories, some of which are further organised into sub-categories.

## Collapsed Blocks

A block can be _collapsed_ using the _Collapse Block_ entry of the context menu.
A collapsed block can be _expanded_ using the _Expand Block_ entry of the context menu.

## Colours

## Comment Blocks

Comment blocks, written as a left double quote (‚Äú), are statement blocks located in the _Meta_ category.
They have a single text field which is printed, as a comment, when the block is evaluated.
By convention synthesiser programs begin with a comment block.

## Comments

There are three kinds of comments:

1. Comment Blocks
2. Block Comments
3. Workspace Comments

## Context menus

A context menu contains a list of actions related to an element in the workspace, or to the workspace itself.
A context menu is shown on right mouse clicks and long presses.

## Copy & Paste

A block can be copied by typing _Ctl-c_ and a copied block can be pasted by typing _Ctl-v_.

## Deleting Blocks

Blocks can be deleted using the _Delete_ entry in the context menu or by pressing the _Delete_ key.
When a block is deleted all of its descendents are deleted along with it.
Deletion can be _undone_.

## Dropdown Menus

## Duplicate

A block can be _duplicated_ using the _Duplicate_ entry of the context menu.

## Expression Blocks

An expression block (also called a function block or a value block) is a block that answers an output value (at an output connector) and accepts one or more inputs (at input fields).
See also _Statement Block_.

## External Inputs

Blocks can be drawn with either _Internal Inputs_ or _External inputs_.
There is a context menu item to select between the two drawing modes.
The figure below shows the ‚àø (_SinOsc_) block with external inputs.

## External Synthesiser

Block SuperCollider ordinarily runs a copy of the SuperCollider synthesiser (`scsynth`) within the browser.
However it can also communicate with an external synthesiser by sending messages over a socket.

## Help

## Guide

There is an online [Guide](https://rohandrape.net/pub/blksc3/blksc3.html?e=help/guide/--Guide--).
The _Guide_ menu can be selected using the _g_ access key.
The Guide consists of a sequence of small example programs each with extensive notes.

## Idioms

An idiom is, as in Apl, a composite sequence of blocks that is often used.
The Toolbox contains a number of idioms.

## Input Kinds

There are two kinds of inputs, _value_ inputs and _statement_ inputs.
Value inputs accept an expression block.
Statement inputs accept one or more statement blocks.

## Internal Inputs

Blocks can be drawn with either _Internal Inputs_ or _External inputs_.
There is a context menu item to select between the two drawing modes.
The figure below shows the ‚àø (_SinOsc_) block with internal inputs.

<img src="sw/blksc3/png/SinOsc.internal.png" width="250" height="48">

Cf. External Inputs.

## Left to right

Ordinarily the system is in left-to-right mode.
In this case the block name is at the left,
the inputs run from left to right,
and the output connector is on the left edge.

## Naming Schema

The ùëÅ control selects between symbolic and text naming schemas.
Some equivalent names are ‚àø=_SinOsc_ and ‚â§=_LessThanOrEqualTo_.

## Scalable Vector Graphics

The workspace can be saved as a Scalable Vector Graphics file.
An image of the [Why SuperCollider?](sw/blksc3/svg/Why%20Block%20SuperCollider.svg) graph.

## Shadow block

A shadow block is an editable but non-movable block connected to another block.
Blocks can be placed on top of shadow blocks to overwrite them.

## Small Programs

There is a list of [Small Programs](https://rohandrape.net/pub/blksc3/blksc3.html?e=help/graph/--Small%20Programs--).
These are programs that will draw within the workspace on a 1366√ó768 display.
The _Small Programs_ menu can be selected using the _a_ access key.

## Statement Blocks

A statement block is a block that does not answer a value,
and therefore does not have an output connector.
Instead statements may have a previous statement connector at the top (for instance ‚ä≥),
or a next statement connector at the bottom,
or both (for instance ‚Äú).
Statement blocks are connected together into statement stacks.
See also _Expression Block_.

## Statement Input

A statement input accepts one or more statement blocks.
The figure below shows the no-argument Œª (_Lambda_) block.
The ‚¶ô (_Statements_) input is a statement input,
the ‚Üê (_Return_) input is a value input.

## Symbolic Naming Schema

The figure below shows the ‚àø (_SinOsc_) block using the symbolic naming scheme.

<img src="sw/blksc3/png/SinOsc.internal.png" width="250" height="48">

The symbols used are:

- ‚àø: sine
- ŒΩ: frequency
- œï: phase
- √ó: multiply
- +: add

The naming scheme also applies to menu fields.
The figure below shows the ‚ä• (_False_) block using the symbolic naming scheme.

<img src="sw/blksc3/png/False.png" width="60" height="41">

## Text Naming Schema

The figure below shows the ‚àø (_SinOsc_) block using the text naming scheme.
In this scheme the input names are elided.

<img src="sw/blksc3/png/SinOsc.internal.text.png" width="210" height="46">

The naming scheme also applies to menu fields.
The figure below shows the ‚ä• (_False_) block using the text naming scheme.

## Toolbox

The area to the left of the workspace is called the _Toolbox_.
The toolbox contains instances of all of the blocks the system knows about, organised into categories.
Blocks are fetched by dragging them out of the toolbox and into the workspace.
There is a [Toolbox](https://rohandrape.net/pub/blksc3/blksc3.html?e=help/guide/1.03%20Toolbox) section in the _Guide_.

## Translation

## Type Annotations

Type annotations constrain how blocks can be connected together.
There is a [Type Annotations](http://blksc3.rohandrape.net/?e=help/guide/2.05%20Type%20Annotations) section in the _Guide_.

## Undo

Actions can be _undone_ by typing _Ctl-u_,
and _redone_ by typing _Ctl-y_.

## Unicode

Lisp editors will often display the typed text `lambda` using the glyph `Œª`.
We can extend this mechanism so that the text

> `SinOsc(freq: 440, phase: 0, mul: 1, add: 0)`

is displayed as

> `‚àø(ŒΩ: 440, œï: 0, √ó: 1, +: 0)`

## Value Input

A value input accepts an expression block.
The figure below shows the no-argument Œª (_Lambda_) block.
The ‚¶ô (_Statements_) input is a statement input,
the ‚Üê (_Return_) input is a value input.

<img src="sw/blksc3/png/Lambda.zero.stm.png" width="67" height="77">

## Workspace

The area containing the block drawing is called the _Workspace_.
There is a [Workspace](https://rohandrape.net/pub/blksc3/blksc3.html?e=help/guide/1.02%20Workspace,%20Synthesiser) section in the _Guide_.

## Workspace Comments

_Workspace comments_ are texts that are attached to the workspace using the _Add comment_ context menu entry.
The text is displayed in a box that can be moved and resized, and has a header that allows the comment to be _collapsed_.
The comment text is not printed.

## Zoom

The workspace has controls to zoom in (‚äï) and out (‚äñ) of the drawing, and to center it at its initial scale (‚äô).
A mouse scroll wheel will also control workspace scaling.
