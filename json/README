blksc3-std.json & blksc3-compact.json:

	"-std" had non-unit generator block definitions with dummy inputs.
	These place the block name and first parameter on separate lines.
	"-compact" had variants of the -std blocks without the dummy inputs.
	These blocks take up less vertical space when drawn with external inputs.
