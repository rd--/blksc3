# List Inputs, List Expansion

When a signal block receives a list as an input there are two distinct behaviors.

In one case the block answers a list of signals.
_SinOsc([440, 441], 0)_ has the same meaning as _[SinOsc(440, 0), SinOsc(441, 0)]_.
This behaviour is called _list expansion_, and is the ordinary rule for SuperCollider unit generators.

In the other case the block expects a list as an input and processes it directly.
‚òú (_Select_) uses ‚òû (_which_) to index into ‚ü¶‚üß (_list_).
The list input allows _Select_ to switch between any number of signals.
This behaviour is called _list processing_, and is the exception for SuperCollider unit generators.
In SuperCollider this rule is specific to particular inputs, _Select_ is still subject to list expansion at _which_.

In this program there are two sine oscillators,
in both cases frequencies are selected from the list _m_,
in one case indexed by ‚òüùë• in the other by ‚òüùë¶.
