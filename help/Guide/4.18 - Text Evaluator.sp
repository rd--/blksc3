# Annotation

Since block drawings are evaluated by first being translated into text programs,
it is straightforward for the system to evaluate text programs as well.
The _â€²_ button will play either the selected text or,
if no text is selected,
the paragraph at the cursor.

The text in the _Notes_ area can be edited.
