# Annotation

To make sound the block program is translated into a _Simple Programming Language_ (Sᴘʟ) program,
which is then evaluated to send control messages to the synthesiser.

The text below is the Sᴘʟ translation of the drawing at the left,
the ⍰𝒘 block is a white noise generator,
the ⋏ block is a resonant filter.
