# Annotation

The editor has two parts,
a _workspace_ where the drawing is made,
and a _toolbox_ from which the blocks for the drawing are taken.

Blocks can be moved about the workspace and connected and disconnected from each other using the mouse.
The ␊⍰₂ block is a low frequency noise generator.
