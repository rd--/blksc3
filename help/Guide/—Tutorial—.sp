# Annotation

The _Tutorial_, ยง4 of the _Guide_, consists of a sequence of very short texts,
each annotating a brief program.

In particular,
tutorial texts are written so they can be displayed using the _%ร%|50_ screen layout,
where half the space is devoted to the notes,
which are shown in a large font.
