# Annotation

A toolbox is an organised collection of block programs.
There can be any number of toolboxes,
and they can be switched between as required.

The 𝑇 button selects between the _Complete Toolbox_,
which has nested sub-categories and a search mechanism,
and the _Small Toolbox_,
which inludes only a subset of the defined blocks arranged into a simpler structure.
