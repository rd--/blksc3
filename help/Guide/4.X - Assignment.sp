# Annotation

The assignment block â‰” sets the value of a variable.
Because block drawings are of trees and not graphs,
if the answer of a block is to be used in more than one place it must be named.
This program is translated from a _one-line_ SuperCollider program by L. Putnam,
[No. 12(d)](https://w2.mat.ucsb.edu/l.putnam/sc3one/index.html).
It is another of the _Small Programs_ included with the system.
