# Annotation

The _Toolbox_ contains instances of the blocks the system knows about, organised into categories.
Blocks are fetched by dragging them out of the toolbox and into the workspace.

A toolbox is an organised collection of block programs,
there can be any number of these,
and they can be switched between.
The ùëá button selects between the _Complete_ and the _Small_ toolbox.
