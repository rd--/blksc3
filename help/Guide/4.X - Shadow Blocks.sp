# Annotation

A shadow block is an editable but non-movable block connected to another block.
Toolbox entries ordinarily have shadow blocks at each input specifying a _default value_.
Blocks can be placed on top of shadow blocks to overwrite them,
the ν and ¹⁄𝑄 inputs have shadow blocks beneath the number blocks.
Editing a shadow block value creates an actual block and connects it into place.
