_Adsr_ is an attack-decay-sustain-release envelope generator.

The ⎇ (_gate_) input begins the envelope on a rising zero crossing and holds it open until a falling zero crossing.

The ↗ (_attack_), ↘ (_decay_) and ⇲ (_release_) times are all given in seconds.

The (implicit) _peak level_ is 1 and ⎺ (the _sustain level_) is relative to the peak level.

The ⟦𝑓⟧ (_curves_) input may be either a scalar or an array of three places.
