⏢ (_Asr_) is an attack-sustain-release envelope generator.

The ⎇ (_gate_) input begins the envelope on a rising zero crossing and holds it open until a falling zero crossing.

The ↗ (_attack_) and ⇲ (_release_) times are given in seconds.

The (implicit) _peak level_ is 1.

The ⟦𝑓⟧ (_curves_) input may be either a scalar or an array of two places.
