(* ---- notes.md ---- *)
_n_ is pink noise is enveloped by a decaying impulse signal.

_l_ is the local input summed with _n_ in the left channel.

_d_ is _l_ delayed by 1/5 of a second.

_o_ sends the reverse of _d_, scaled by 4/5, to the local output.

The output of the program is _d_.

The â…„ operator references _o_ so that it is included in the signal processing graph but otherwise ignores it.
