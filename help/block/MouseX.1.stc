//---- notes.md
☟𝑥 (_MouseX_) reads  the _x_ axis location of the mouse on the screen.
☟𝑥 is located in the _Control_ category of the toolbox.

⌊ (_minval_) and ⌈ (_maxval_) define the output range.
𝑓 (_warp_) is either 0 for a _linear_ mapping or 1 for _exponential_.
⎎ (_lag_) is a smoothing parameter, indicating the time taken for the signal to converge to within 0.01%.

In this program ☟𝑥 controls the ν (_frequency_) input of one ∿ (_SinOsc_),
☟𝑦 controls the ν of another, and also the amplitude of both.

The // (_LinLin_), /ノ (_LinExp_) and ⎎ (_Lag_) blocks at ☟𝑦 perform the same function as the ⌊, ⌈, 𝑓 and ⎎ inputs at ☟𝑥.
