_Adsr_ is an attack-decay-sustain-release envelope generator.

The _gate_ input begins the envelope on a rising zero crossing and holds it open until a falling zero crossing.

The _attack_, _decay_ and _release_ times are all given in seconds.

The _curve_ input may be a scalar or an array of three places.
