Having a separate message,
often used to allow blocks to be translated into different languages,
also allows blocks to be displayed using symbolic notations that would not be allowed as identifiers in _.stc_.

✐ is the message indicating a _Comment_ block, 🔊 a _Play_ block, ∿ a _SinOsc_ block and ⊥ an _Impulse_ block.

ν is symbol used in messages to indicate a _frequency_ parameter, ϕ a _phase_ parameter, × a _mul_ parameter and + an _add_ parameter.

⌈ is the symbol used in messages to indicate the _max_ binary operator. (It also indicates the _ceil_ unary operator).

Symbolic names for common blocks and parameters makes graphs drawings much more concise.
These names do not ever need to be typed, only recognised.

This program generates a quiet impulse stream of time varying frequency in the left channel.
