Œª (_Proc_) is the anonymous procedure block.
It is located in the _Proc_ category of the toolbox.
Œª is a _value block_, it has an _output connector_ to receive the ‚Üê (_return_) value.

Œª has a number of distinct shapes.
It may take zero, one (‚çµ) or two (‚çµ & ‚ç∫) input parameter names.
It may or may not allow a sequence of statements (‚Ä¶).

Œª encapsulates a program fragment.
A Œª block may be _evaluated_ to run the program fragment it holds and to return its result.
When evaluated, a Œª block must be passed the appropriate number of arguments, one for each declared parameter.

! (_ArrayFill_) is a graph combinator, a form of _higher order function_.
! requires a zero argument Œª block (ùëì) and an integer (#) as inputs.
! generates an ‚ü¶‚üß (_Array_) of # places, and evaluates ùëì # times, once for each place, to set its values.

This program sums twelve sine oscillators,
with random frequencies in _(110, 220)_ _hz_,
amplitude modulated by sine oscillators with random frequencies in _(0.1, 0.5)_ _hz_,
and arranges them equidistantly across the stereo field.
Each time this program is played it sounds differently,
the frequencies have the same random distribution, but different values.
