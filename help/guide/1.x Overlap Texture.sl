# Overlap Texture

·®è (_OverlapTexture_) is a graph combinator, a form of _higher order function_.
·®è requires a one argument Œª block as an input.

·®è makes # (_overlap_) parallel copies of the graph fragment at ùëì (_proc_).
Each copy forms one voice of an evolving texture.

·®è applies a simple linear envelope to each voice.
The envelope is defined by two parameters, ‚§¢ (_transition time_) and ‚åí (_sustain time_).
The duration of the envelope is: 2 √ó ‚§¢ + ‚åí.

The envelopes of each voice are reset at equally spaced regular intervals.
The interval between between resets is: (2 √ó ‚§¢ + ‚åí) √∑ #.

The argument to ùëì is a signal that indicates to the voice when its envelope is reset,
allowing voices to move to a new state for each iteration.

This program generates a texture of 12 voices, each a single ‚àø (_SinOsc_).
On each envelope reset the ŒΩ (_frequency_), ‚åñ (_stereo location_) and √ó (_amplitude_) are reset to new randomly selected values (‚§¥‚öÅ).
In this program Œª has no statements.
