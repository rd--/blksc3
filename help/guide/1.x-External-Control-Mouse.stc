## External Control, Mouse

SuperCollider includes three unit generators to read the mouse state as a control signal, _MouseX_, _MouseY_ and _MouseButton_.

These unit generators do not work in the web assembly variant of the SuperCollider synthesiser.
Instead the mouse controls are implemented in terms of _Pointer_ pseudo unit-generators.

The Pointer input area is restricted to the _blksc3_ page, not the screen as a whole, and the update rate is slower than in the ordinary case.

The Pointer update rate is a function of the audio block size set when the synthesiser is started.
The default value is _2048_ and there is a _Block Size_ entry  in the â˜° menu to set this value.

Smaller block sizes result in better latency for external controls, including the mouse.
However the synthesiser is more susceptible to interruption from other tasks.
