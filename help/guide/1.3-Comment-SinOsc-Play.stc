✐ has an editable text _Input Field_.
Comments have no effect, they are a note to the reader of the program.

🔊 has an _Input Value_ connector on its right edge.
🔊 indicates that its input should be sent to the synthesiser outputs.

∿ is the _SinOsc_ block, a sine wave oscillator.
It is located in the _Osc_ category.

∿ is a _Value Block_, meaning it has an _Output Value_ connector on it's left edge.
In this program the _Output Value_ of ∿ is connected to the _Input Value_ of 🔊.

∿ has four labelled _Input Value_ connectors on it's right edge.
ν indicates the frequency input, ϕ the phase input, × the multiplier and + the adder.

In this program each input of ∿ has a _Number_ block connected to it.
Number blocks are located in the _Constants_ category.

This program generates a quiet sine tone at 440hz in the left channel.
