// ✐ (Comment) Block, ∿ (SinOsc) Block, 🔊 (Play) Block
SinOsc(440, 0) * 0.1

//---- notes.md
`✐` is the _Comment_ block and `🔊` is the _Play_ block.
Both are located in the _Meta_ category of the _ToolBox_.

✐ and 🔊 are _Statement Blocks_, meaning they have _Previous_ and _Next_ connectors at their top and bottom edges.
Here ✐ is connected to 🔊.

✐ has an editable text _Input Field_.
Comments have no effect, they are a note to the reader of the program.

🔊 has an _Input Value_ connector on its right edge.
This block indicates that its input should be sent to the synthesiser outputs.

_∿_ is the _SinOsc_ block, a sine wave oscillator.
It is located in the _Osc_ category.

∿ is a _Value Block_, meaning it has an _Output Value_ connector on it's left edge.
Here ∿ is connected to 🔊.

∿ has four labelled _Input Value_ connectors on it's right edge.
`ν` indicates the frequency input, `ϕ` the phase input, `×` the multiplier and `+` the adder.

Each input has a _Number_ block connected to it.
Number blocks are located in the _Constants_ category.

This program generates a quiet sine tone at 440hz in the left channel.
