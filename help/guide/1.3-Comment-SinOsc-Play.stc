✐ (_Comment_) and 🔊 (_Play_) are located in the _Meta_ category of the toolbox.
✐ and 🔊 are _statement blocks_, meaning they have _previous_ and _next_ connectors at their top and bottom edges.
In this program ✐ is followed by 🔊.

✐ has an editable text _input field_.
Comments have no effect, they are a note to the reader of the program.
🔊 has an _input value_ connector on its right edge.
🔊 indicates that its input should be sent to the synthesiser outputs.

∿ (_SinOsc_) is a sine wave oscillator.
It is located in the _Osc_ category.
∿ is a _value block_, meaning it has an _output value_ connector on it's left edge.
In this program the output of ∿ is connected to the input of 🔊.

∿ has four labelled _input value_ connectors on it's right edge.
ν indicates the frequency input, ϕ the phase input, × the multiplier and + the adder.

In this program each input of ∿ has a _number_ block connected to it.
Number blocks are located in the _Constants_ category.

This program consists of seven blocks.
It generates a quiet sine tone at 440 _hz_ in the left channel.
