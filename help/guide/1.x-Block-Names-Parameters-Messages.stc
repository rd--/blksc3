// Block Names, Parameters, Messages
Impulse(SinOsc(1, 0).max(0), 0) * 0.1

//---- notes.md
_Blocks_ and block _Parameters_ (inputs) all have _Names_.
These names are used as identifiers when programs are stored in _.xml_ files,
and when they are sent to the synthesiser as _.stc_ expressions.

Blocks also define a _Message_, which is used to construct the text displayed in the block drawing.
This message is distinct from both the block name and from the parameter names.

Having a separate message allows blocks to be translated into different languages,
and to be displayed using symbolic notations that would not be allowed as identifiers in _.stc_.

✐ is the message indicating a _Comment_ block, 🔊 a _Play_ block, ∿ a _SinOsc_ block and ⊥ an _Impulse_ block.

ν is symbol used in messages to indicate a _frequency_ parameter, ϕ a _phase_ parameter, × a _mul_ parameter and + an _add_ parameter.

⌈ is the symbol used in messages to indicate the _max_ binary operator. (It also indicates the _ceil_ unary operator).

Symbolic names for common blocks and parameters makes graphs drawings much more concise.
These names do not ever need to be typed, only recognised.

To see the names of blocks and their parameters hover the mouse over a block and a small help message will appear:

> _SinOsc(freq, phase): Interpolating sine wavetable oscillator._

This program generates a quiet impulse stream of time varying frequency in the left channel.
