Impulse(SinOsc(1, 0).max(0), 0) * 0.1

_Blocks_ and block _Parameters_ (inputs) all have names.
These names are what is stored in block _.xml_ files, and what are used to form _.stc_ expressions.

A block drawing displays a _Message_.
This display message is distinct from it's names.
This allows blocks to be translated into different languages,
or to use symbolic message notations that would not be allowed in _.stc_.

✐ is the message string indicating a _Comment_ block, 🔊 a _Play_ block, ∿ a _SinOsc_ block and ⊥ an _Impulse_ block.

ν is the message string indicating a _frequency_ parameter, ϕ a _phase_ parameter, × a _mul_ parameter and + an _add_ parameter.

⌈ is the message indicating the _max_ binary operator. (It also indicates the _ceil_ unary operator).

Symbolic names for common blocks and parameters makes graphs drawings much more concise.
These names do not ever need to be typed, only recognised.

To see the names of blocks and their parameters hover the mouse a block and a small help message will appear.
