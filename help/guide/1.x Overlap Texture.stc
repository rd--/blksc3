## Overlap Texture

ᨏ (_OverlapTexture_) is a graph combinator, a form of _higher order function_.
ᨏ requires a one argument λ block as an input.

ᨏ makes # (_overlap_) parallel copies of the graph fragment at 𝑓 (_proc_).
Each copy forms one voice of an evolving texture.

ᨏ applies a simple linear envelope to each voice.
The envelope is defined by two parameters, ⤢ (_transition time_) and ⌒ (_sustain time_).
The duration of the envelope is: 2 × ⤢ + ⌒.

The envelopes of each voice are reset at equally spaced regular intervals.
The interval between between resets is: (2 × ⤢ + ⌒) ÷ #.

The argument to 𝑓 is a signal that indicates to the voice when its envelope is reset,
allowing voices to move to a new state for each iteration.

This program generates a texture of 12 voices, each a single ∿ (_SinOsc_).
On each envelope reset the ν (_frequency_), ⌖ (_stereo location_) and × (_amplitude_) are reset to new randomly selected values (⤴⚁).
In this program λ has no statements.
