Many music synthesisers, including _SuperCollider_, have two distinct operating rates, audio rate and control rate.
A typical configuration sets the audio rate to 48,000 _hz_ and the control rate to 1,000 _hz_.

There are two ways the _SuperCollider_ synthesiser receives control signals.
One is directly from a special purpose unit generator, such as ‚òüùë• (_MouseX_).
The other is indirectly by reading from a control bus.

Control buses are integer indexed.
They are set by sending a _/c_set_ message to the synthesiser, and read using a unit generator.

Values at control buses have no fixed meaning.
A control system consists of an agreement between about the meaning of signals at particular control buses.

Three such systems are:

1. _Cc(n)_ reads from continuous controller _n_ with the implicit range _(0, 1)_.
2. _Sw(n)_ reads from switch _n_ that is either _closed_ (0) or _open_ (1).
3. _Voicer(f, n)_ reads _n_ event streams, where an event is a set of control parameters associated with a _gate_ signal.

In this program event data is read for parameters _p_ (linear pitch), _y_ (location in y-axis), _w_ (gate) and _z_ (pressure).

The first two continuous controller inputs are read and set the reverb _mix_ and _room_ parameters.
