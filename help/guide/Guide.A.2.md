_WhiteNoise_ is a white generator, it is located in the _Noise_ category of the ToolBox.

_Resonz_ is a resonant filter, it is located in the _Reson_ category.

_MouseX_ and _MouseY_ are control generators, reading the _x_ and _y_ axis locations of the mouse on the screen.
They are located in the _Control_ category.

WhiteNoise is a generator and has the same colour as other generators such as SinOsc.

Resonz is a filter, it processes an input signal, and is coloured differently.

MouseX and MouseY are control signals, and are coloured differently again.

In this program the WhiteNoise, MouseX and MouseY blocks are drawn with _Internal Inputs_.
The Resonz block is drawn with _External Inputs_.

The block context menu, located by right clicking on a block, allows changing between these two drawing modes.

This program makes a filtered noise tone, the amplitude of the noise generator and the width of the resonant filter and controlled by the mouse location.
